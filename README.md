# Programming-and-Data-Structure
This is a repository for the course VE 280 Programming and Elementary Data Structure.

For each project, the description (project requirements) is included in 'Project-N-Description.pdf'.

Here is a brief introduction to each project:

P1: Get familiar with C++ : Usage of I/O, arithmetic operators, branch and loop.

P2: Implementations of List and Binary Tree. You are required to write all function in a recursive way.

P3: Build a mini-world where different creatures live and interact with each other. This project aims to improve your ability in using arrays, pointers, structs, enums, program arguments and different I/O streams.

P4: Implement a two-player board game 'Quarto', using Abstract Data Types (ADTs), interfaces (abstract base classes) and other techniques that are often used in object-oriented programming (such as inheritance and polymophic).

P5: Build a reverse-Polish notation calculator and a call center simulation program using dynamic memory management, opeartor overloading and template container class (list, stack and queue).

CAUTION:
Please abide by the Honor Code if you are now taking this course.
